## How to Run the Projects

Follow the steps below to set up the environment and run the workflows for each project:


### Step 1: Clone the Repository
Clone this repository to your local machine:

git clone https://github.com/AIDEdgeInc-Lab/Core-Projects.git


---

### Step 2: Set Up the Environment

Install required dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Configure necessary environment variables (if needed):
```bash
export DATA_PATH=/path/to/dataset
export MODEL_PATH=/path/to/model
```


---

### Step 3: Run Individual Projects

#### Edge AI Solutions

- Navigate to the Edge-AI-Solutions folder:

```bash
cd Edge-AI-Solutions
```
- Run the inference script:

```bash
python inference.py --input data/sample_input.jpg
```
---
#### Tiny ML Optimization

- Navigate to the TinyML-Optimization folder:

```bash
cd TinyML-Optimization
```

- Run the model quantization script:

```bash
python quantize_model.py --model models/model.tflite
```
---
#### Hybrid ML Frameworks

- Navigate to the Hybrid-ML-Frameworks folder:

```bash
cd Hybrid-ML-Frameworks
```

- Set up the cloud-edge integration:

```bash
python cloud_edge_setup.py --config configs/cloud_edge_config.yaml
```

- Run the hybrid inference model:

```bash
python hybrid_inference.py --input data/input.json
```
